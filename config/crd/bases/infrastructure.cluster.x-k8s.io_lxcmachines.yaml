                  Devices allows overriding the configuration of the instance disk or network.

                  Device configuration must be formatted using the syntax "<device>,<key>=<value>".

                  For example, to specify a different network for an instance, you can use:

                  ```yaml
                    # override device "eth0", to be of type "nic" and use network "my-network"
